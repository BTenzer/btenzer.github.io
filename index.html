          <p class="myBio paraText">With respect to Archilochus, learned scholarship has revealed that he introduced the folk song into literature
              and that, because of this achievement, he earned his place next to Homer in the universal estimation of the
              Greeks. But what is the folk song in comparison to the completely Apollonian epic poem? What else but the
              perpetuum vestigum [the eternal mark]
               of a union between the Apollonian and the Dionysian? Its tremendous
              expansion, extending to all peoples and constantly increasing with new births, testifies to us how strong that
              artistic duality of nature is: which, to use an analogy, leaves its trace behind in the folk song just as the
              orgiastic movements of a people leave their traces in its music. Indeed, it must also be historically
              demonstrable how that period rich in folk songs at the same time was stirred in the strongest manner by
              Dionysian trends, something which we have to recognize as the foundation and precondition of folk songs.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="myBio paraText">Hence, confronted by the Greeks, people have been ashamed and afraid. It seems that an individual who
              values the truth above everything else might dare to propose as true the notion that the Greeks drive the
              chariot of our culture and every other one, but that almost always the wagon and the horses are inferior
              material and cannot match the glory of their drivers, who then consider it funny to whip such a team into the
              abyss, over which they themselves jump with a leap worthy of Achilles.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="myBio paraText">Before we designate this other spectator by name, let's linger here a moment to reconsider that characteristic
              duality and incommensurability at the heart of Aeschylean tragedy (something we described earlier). Let us
              think about how strange we find the chorus and the hero of those tragedies, which were not able to reconcile
              with what we are used to or with our traditions, until we recognized that duality itself as the origin and
              essence of Greek tragedy, as the expression of two artistic drives woven together, the Apollonian and the
              Dionysian.</p>

          <br>    
          <br>
          <div class="sectionPadding" id="contactText"></div>
          <div class="container sectionHeading">
              <p>contacts</p>
          </div>

          <p class="myBio paraText">Consequently, people looked for an earthly solution to tragic dissonance. After the hero was sufficiently
              tortured by fate, he was paid a well earned reward in an impressive marriage, in divine testament to his
              honour. The hero became a gladiator, to whom people gave his freedom, after he had been well beaten and
              was covered with wounds. The deus ex machina moved in to take the place of metaphysical consolation. I will
              not say that the tragic world view was destroyed entirely and completely by the surging spirit of the
              unâˆ’Dionysian. We only know that it must have fled out of art as if into the underworld, degenerating into a
              secret cult.</p>
